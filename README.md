# ðŸŽµ WebMusic Player ðŸŽµ

Welcome to the WebMusic Player, a music player created from scratch with inspiration from Spotify. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a simple yet enjoyable music streaming experience.

## Features:
- User-friendly interface inspired by Spotify
- Pre-loaded with a curated selection of songs
- Easy navigation and playback controls

## Usage:
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Browse through the available songs and click on your desired track.
3. Enjoy the music with playback controls for play, pause, prev-track, next-track.

## Note:
- The website is currently not fully responsive, and I am actively working on improving its compatibility with various devices.

Thank you for using the WebMusic Player! ðŸŽ¶
